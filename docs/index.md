# Welcome to Algone Library

Algone is a library for **machine learning** and **data science**. It is written in C by me as a student. Because I learned C by myself, **please, don't use Algone in production**, I can't give any guarantee that Algone will work properly despite the unit tests I've set up.

Contributions are open and welcome for every one :D

## Organisation of documentation
